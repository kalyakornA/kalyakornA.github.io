This project is the final project for the **Intelligent Service-Oriented Software Design and Development (iSOA)** class at **Tsinghua University**, taught by <a href="https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/">Prof. Jie Tang</a>. Our team consists of myself, Brian, and Chris.


**WEGO (Worldwide Exploration Guide Online)** is an AI-powered vacation planner that helps users effortlessly create detailed travel itineraries. It combines destination information, weather forecasts, and flight details to provide informed travel plans. With LLM-powered customer support, users can easily make changes and inquire about their trip using natural language.

I am responsible for the frontend design, using <b>React, TypeScript, and the Ant Design Framework</b>. Please refer to our <a href="/assets/projects/2024_wego-travel-planner/wego_report.pdf">report</a> for implementation details.
