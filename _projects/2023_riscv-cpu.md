This project is the final project for the **Computer Organization** class at **Tsinghua University**, taught by <a href="https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1108/3941.htm">Prof. Youyou Lu</a>. Our team consists of myself, Nuoqi Gui, and Herui Fang.

This project involves the design and implementation of a <b>5-stage pipeline RISC-V processor</b>, capable of executing RV32I instructions, with additional features such as memory access, UART communication, interrupt handling and virtual memory. The processor is implemented on the ThinPAD-Cloud platform using FPGA tools like Vivado, aiming to run a 32-bit monitor program and execute user-defined assembly programs.
